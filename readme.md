#String Extensions
These are mostly for me to determine whether or not I could actually do this. I could not, as the string class in java is final. You're not allowed to extend it. So I made this.

##dstring.DChar
dstring.DChar = Doug Char. I am doug, nice to meet you. This provides some methods that work with chars. I made these in my 'hearts' project as a means to split up a seed and shuffle a deck, but it felt out of place in a card libary so I moved it to its own thing.

##dstring.DWord
You get the naming convention by now I assume. Manipulate and analyze words.
